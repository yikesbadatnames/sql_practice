### QUERY 1

* Here I have joined three tables: orders (1.5 billion rows), nation (25 rows), customer (150 million rows). The question I asked here was, how is how much money is tied into the order status of an item across all countries. 
    * There isn't much variation across the order status groups based on the heat map. I conducted further analysis to find the averages of the group.
